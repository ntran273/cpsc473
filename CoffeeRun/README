Complete the following:
Work through Chapter 8 to create the DataStore and Truck models.

As you work in the DevTools Console,
keep in mind that you can recall previously executed code using the Up and Down
arrow keys on the keyboard.



While the DevTools Console is nice,
 it would be better to have the test code saved permanently.
  Create a new directory named tests/ in your coffeerun repository,
  then save the code in Figure 8.10 into a file named test_datastore.js
  and the code in Figure 8.32 to a file named test_truck.js.


Copy index.html into the tests/ directory and modify it to load the test files as well as the original code.
 Verify that when you load tests/index.html, the output matches Figures 8.10 and 8.32.
  (Note that this may require you to add some additional calls to console.log().)
Create a new tests/main.js to allow tests to be run from the command line with Node.js by typing
$ node tests/main.js
at the command prompt.  When you run main.js, you should see the same output as step (3) above,
except on the command line rather than in the DevTools Console.
In order to complete this step, you will need to be able load your JavaScript files into Node.js.
 For a simple way to do this, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/9823294.



Complete Chapters 9 and 10 to create a form, style it with Bootstrap, and use jQuery to define a FormHandler object.
Push the contents of your coffeerun directory into a new public GitHub repository.
